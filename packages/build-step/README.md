# Build-Step

Here you can find a sample project illustrating the `build-step` exercises.

First, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then, run `npm run build` to build all files.

Finally, run `npm run start` to start an HTTP server. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/html/`
to view the page.

You can then run `npm run build-dev` to watch for changes and rebuild automatically.
